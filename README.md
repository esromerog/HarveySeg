##Â Description
This is a repository meant for the project Harvey, Surgical Assistance. This repository contains the models used for automatic segmentation of brain tumors and for finding a brain atlas. By using [SynthSeg](https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg) and [mmFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02425) we aim to provide a multi-modal compatible inference pipeline. It was built using [samples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JtFxDnNIxH9abob2lcpDsHhiVKEPohKh?usp=share_link) from the BraTS2020 dataset.
